**xserver** is my personal server setup. This repository contains configurations, scripts, and notes for running and managing the services I use on my homelab server.

## 💡 Why "xserver"?

I wanted a simple, system-style name like `xserver` or `systemd`. This isn't a display server — it's just the name of my personal server project.
